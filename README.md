# VectorBeWinding ![Travis](https://travis-ci.org/dagezi/vector_be_winding.svg?branch=master)

Android Vector Drawable is very convenient,
but sometimes it missing holes in the shape generated by some tools.
`vector_be_winding` will massage such Vector Drawalbes
so that the shape will be rendered as expected!


Try [SampleApp](https://github.com/dagezi/vector_be_winding/tree/master/sampleApp) to see how it works.

## Installation

```
gem install vector_be_winding
```

## Usage

Just exec:

`% vbw vector_file.xml vector_file_1.xml ...`

Then the vector drawable files which doesn't follow winding rules will be
automatically converted and the back-up file with `.bak` extension will
be create.

### Options
- `-v` : verbose; shows the file which will be converted
- `-n` : dry run
- `-i` : specify the template of back up file name.
